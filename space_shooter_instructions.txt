Space Shooter User Manual
How to Run the Program:
Install Python and Pygame on your system.
Run the main.py file to launch the arcade menu.
Choose "Play Space Shooter" from the main menu to begin the game.
Valid Inputs and Expected Outputs:

Description of How the Code Works:
Initialization:

The game initializes Pygame and sets up a window with specific dimensions.
Defines color schemes and ship, bullet, and enemy properties, including size, speed, and color.
Game Mechanics:

Player Ship: A spaceship is positioned at the bottom center of the screen, controlled by the player.
Enemies: Enemy ships spawn at the top and move downwards at a set speed.
Bullets: When the player presses 'Space', bullets are fired from the ship, moving upwards to hit enemies.
Collision Detection:
When a bullet hits an enemy, both the bullet and the enemy are removed from the game.
If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen or collides with the player's ship, the game ends.
Scoring System:
The player earns points for each enemy hit by bullets.
The score is displayed at the top left of the screen.
Game Loop:

The main game loop continually updates the game state based on player inputs and game logic.
Processes keyboard inputs for moving the ship and shooting.
Updates positions of bullets and enemies.
Checks for collisions and updates the score accordingly.
Renders all game elements (ship, enemies, bullets, score, and exit button) onto the screen.
Difficulty Increase:

As the player's score increases, the game gradually becomes more challenging by increasing enemy speed.
User Interface:

Includes an exit button to return to the main menu.
Game over screen displays when the player loses, with an option to restart the game or exit.
End of Game:

If the player's ship is hit by an enemy or an enemy reaches the bottom, the game displays a 'Game Over' message.
Players can choose to play again or return to the main menu.
Special Notes:
The game is designed as a single-player experience.
Player's skill in maneuvering and shooting is key to achieving a high score.
The game encourages players to beat their previous high scores by increasing the difficulty as they progress.
