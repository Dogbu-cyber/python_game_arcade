Description of How the Code Works:
Initialization:

The game begins by initializing Pygame and setting up a window with specific dimensions.
A background image is loaded and scaled to fit the window.
Paddle and ball properties are defined, including size, color, and speed.
Game Setup:

Paddles for two players are initialized at specified positions on the screen.
The ball is initialized at the center of the screen with a random initial direction.
Gameplay Mechanics:

The game processes keyboard inputs for moving the paddles.
The ball's movement is updated continuously, bouncing off the top and bottom edges of the screen.
Collision detection checks if the ball hits either paddle and reverses its direction accordingly.
Scoring is updated when the ball passes a paddle, indicating a point for the opposing player.
User Interface:

The game screen is updated regularly to reflect the positions of the paddles and ball.
The current score for each player is displayed at the top of the screen.
An exit message ("Press Space to Exit") is shown, allowing players to return to the main menu.
End of Game:

The game does not have a predefined end point and continues until players choose to exit.
Exiting the game is handled by pressing the 'Space' bar, which returns the player to the main menu.
Special Notes:
The game is designed for two players, each controlling one paddle.
The speed and direction of the ball change dynamically upon hitting paddles or screen edges.
The game requires quick reflexes and coordination between players for an engaging experience.
