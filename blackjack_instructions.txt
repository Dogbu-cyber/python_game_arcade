Blackjack User Manual
How to Run the Program:
Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
Run the main program file (main.py).
From the main menu, select "Play Blackjack" to start the game.
Valid Inputs and Expected Outputs:
Mouse Clicks: Interact with on-screen buttons like "Hit", "Stand", "Play Again", and "Exit".
Hit: Draw another card to try and get closer to a total score of 21.
Stand: End your turn and let the dealer play.
Play Again: Restart the game after it ends.
Exit: Return to the main menu.
Description of How the Code Works:
Initialization:

The game starts by initializing Pygame and setting up the game window with a specific width and height.
A background image for the Blackjack table is loaded and scaled to fit the window.
Global variables for the deck, player's cards, dealer's cards, game over status, and player's turn status are defined.
Game Setup:

The game deck is created with all suits and ranks using the create_deck function.
Card images are loaded using load_card_images, which maps each card to its corresponding image.
The deal_card function is used to draw cards from the deck.
Gameplay Mechanics:

The reset_game function initializes the game by shuffling the deck and dealing the initial cards.
Player interaction is handled through clickable buttons. Clicking "Hit" adds a new card to the player's hand, and "Stand" ends the player's turn.
The player's and dealer's scores are calculated using calculate_score, which also handles the logic for Aces being either 1 or 11.
The game checks for various end conditions like busts (going over 21) or achieving Blackjack (exactly 21).
User Interface:

The game continuously checks for player inputs (mouse clicks) and updates the screen accordingly.
Text is rendered on the screen to display scores and messages using the draw_text function.
Player and dealer hands are visually represented on the screen using draw_hand.
The game loop updates the display after every interaction.
End of Game:

Once the game concludes (either the player stands or busts), the dealer's turn is automatically played following Blackjack rules.
The winner is determined based on the final scores, and an appropriate message is displayed.
The "Play Again" button allows restarting the game, while "Exit" returns to the main menu.
Special Notes:
The game logic closely follows traditional Blackjack rules.
The deck is reshuffled at the start of each new game.
The game is designed for a single player against an automated dealer.
